Project: Image Manipulation

Objective: Create a program that allows users to perform basic image manipulation operations using NumPy.

Features to include:

Image loading: Load an image file into a NumPy array.

Image resizing: Resize the image array to a specified width and height.

Image cropping: Allow users to select a rectangular region of interest (ROI) in the image and crop the array accordingly.

Image rotation: Rotate the image array by a specified angle.

Image flipping: Flip the image horizontally or vertically.

Image grayscale conversion: Convert the image array to grayscale.

Image color inversion: Invert the color values of the image.

Image blending: Blend two images together by combining their pixel values.

Image display: Display the modified image using matplotlib or any other library of your choice.

Image saving: Save the modified image array as a new image file.

You can implement these features as separate functions or methods within a class.
You can also add additional functionalities or modify the project as per your requirements.
